Palettes are sequences (lists or tuples) of RGB(A) hex strings that define a colormap and be can set as the palette attribute of all chart types from bokeh.charts and as the color attribute of many plot objects from bokeh.plotting. Bokeh offers many of the standard Brewer palettes, which can be imported from the bokeh.palettes module. For example, importing “Spectral6” gives a six element list of RBG(A) hex strings from the Brewer “Spectral” colormap.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from bokeh.palettes import Spectral6
>>> Spectral6
['#3288bd', '#99d594', '#e6f598', '#fee08b', '#fc8d59', '#d53e4f']
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
All of the standard palettes included in bokeh can be found at Standard Palettes. Custom palettes can be made by creating sequences of RGB(A) hex strings.
